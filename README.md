This is a small application that visualizes **sorting algorithms** for array data structures. Simple, fun visual cues that reinforces core computer science concepts, namely **Big O Notation**. Maybe using Next.js for this is a bit overkill, but thatâ€™s neither here nor there. Not that tech stacks matter to the user anyways. Oh well, enjoy.
